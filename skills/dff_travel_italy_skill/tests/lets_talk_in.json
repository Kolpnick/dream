Italy is located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, in Southern Europe; it is also considered part of Western Europe. A unitary parliamentary republic with Rome as its capital and largest city, the country covers a total area of and shares land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, as well as the enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino. Italy has a territorial exclave in Switzerland, Campione. With over 60 million inhabitants, Italy is the third-most populous member state of the European Union.",
                                    "The Kingdom of Italy was a state that existed from 1861\u2014when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy\u2014until 1946, when civil discontent led an institutional referendum to abandon the monarchy and form the modern Italian Republic. The state was founded as a result of the Risorgimento under the influence of the Savoy-led Kingdom of Sardinia, which can be considered its legal predecessor state.",

It was fully influenced by revolutionary France and ended with Napoleons defeat and fall. Its government was assumed by Napoleon as King of Italy and the viceroyalty delegated to his step-son Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais. It covered Savoy and the modern provinces of Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Trentino, South Tyrol, and Marche. Napoleon I also ruled the rest of northern and central Italy in the form of Nice, Aosta, Piedmont, Liguria, Tuscany, Umbria, and Lazio, but directly as part of the French Empire, rather than as part of a vassal state.",
                                    "The Kingdom of Italy ( or Regnum Italicum; ), also called Imperial Italy, was one of the constituent kingdoms of the Holy Roman Empire, along with the kingdoms of Germany, Bohemia, and Burgundy. It comprised most of northern and central Italy. Its original capital was Pavia until the 11th century.",

The Italian Fascists imposed authoritarian rule and crushed political and intellectual opposition, while promoting economic modernization, traditional social values and a rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church. According to Payne (1996), \"[the] Fascist government passed through several relatively distinct phases\". The first phase (1922\u20131925) was nominally a continuation of the parliamentary system, albeit with a \"legally-organized executive dictatorship\". The second phase (1925\u20131929) was \"the construction of the Fascist dictatorship proper\". The third phase (1929\u20131934) was with less interventionism in foreign policy. The fourth phase (1935\u20131940) was characterized by an aggressive foreign policy: the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, which was launched from Eritrea and Somaliland; confrontations with the League of Nations, leading to sanctions; growing economic autarky; invasion of Albania; and the signing of the Pact of Steel. The fifth phase (1940\u20131943) was World War II itself which ended in military defeat, while the sixth and final phase (1943\u20131945) was the rump Sal\u00f2 Government under German control."
